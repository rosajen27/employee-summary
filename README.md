# Template Engine - Employee Summary

A Node CLI (command line application) that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person (software engineering team generator). The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of managers, engineers and interns. This CLI also passes all unit tests. 

When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file, team.html, in the output folder that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
